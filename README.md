# Pothole-Detection
Potholes are a major issue for road safety, leading to accidents, vehicle damage, and traffic congestion. Traditional manual detection methods are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to automate pothole detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm based on deep learning.
