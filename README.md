# Pothole-Detection
Potholes are a major issue for road safety, leading to accidents, vehicle damage, and traffic congestion. Traditional manual detection methods are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to automate pothole detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm based on deep learning.
üéØ Objective
To build an efficient and accurate deep learning model that can detect potholes in road images and videos, enabling quicker and more reliable maintenance planning for road authorities.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Input Support: Images and video files (MP4, AVI, etc.)

Output: Bounding boxes around detected potholes

Modes: Training, Validation, Image Detection, Video Detection

Evaluation Metrics: mAP (mean Average Precision), Precision, Recall

üß† How It Works
Data Preparation:

Road images with potholes are collected and labeled using tools like LabelImg.

Annotations are stored in YOLO format (.txt files with bounding box coordinates).

A data.yaml file defines paths to training and validation datasets.

Model Training:

The YOLOv8 model is trained on labeled data to recognize pothole patterns.

Training parameters like batch size, epochs, and image size are customizable.

Validation:

The model is evaluated on a validation set.

Performance is measured using standard object detection metrics.

Inference:

The trained model is used to detect potholes in real-world road images or videos.

Detections are displayed with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
